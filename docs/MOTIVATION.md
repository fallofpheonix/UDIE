# Motivation

## The Problem
Standard navigation apps like Google Maps or Waze focus primarily on **time**. While they aggregate traffic, they often lack a structured **risk layer** for urban infrastructure. A route might be the "fastest" but could pass through high-disruption zones (e.g., heavy water-logging, active protests, or severe construction) that increase cognitive load and vehicle wear.

## The Solution: UDIE
UDIE was conceived to treat **Urban Disruption** as a primary data citizen. By quantifying risk through spatial proximity and event severity, we provide a "safety-first" perspective on urban mobility.

## Goals
1. **Intelligence over ETA**: Provide users with the "why" behind route safety.
2. **PostGIS Power**: Showcase the capability of spatial databases in real-time mobile apps.
3. **Open Extensibility**: Build a scaffold that can ingest data from government portals, social media, and crowdsourced reports.
