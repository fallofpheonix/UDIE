# Potential

UDIE has significant potential across both commercial and public sectors.

## Commercial Utility
- **Last-Mile Logistics**: Companies like Amazon or DHL can save millions by avoiding routes prone to vehicle-damaging disruptions (e.g., deep potholes or unmapped construction).
- **Insurance Telematics**: Insurance providers can offer lower premiums to drivers who consistently choose "low-risk" routes computed by the UDIE engine.

## Civic Impact
- **Urban Planning**: City planners can use UDIE’s historical data to identify which intersections have the highest frequency of accidents or construction delays.
- **Disaster Response**: During monsoon seasons, the "Flood" event layer becomes a critical tool for directing emergency vehicles to safe routes.

## Monetization Paths
- **B2B API**: Charging per 1,000 requests for logistics platforms.
- **Enterprise Dashboard**: A SaaS offering for fleet managers.
- **White-label Solutions**: Licensing the technology to municipal governments.
