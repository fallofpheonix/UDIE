# User Guide

This guide explains how to use the UDIE iOS application to navigate urban environments safely.

## 1. Navigating the Map
- **Location**: Your current position is shown as a blue dot. 
- **Icons**: 
  - ⚠️ **Triangle**: High-severity disruption (e.g., Accident).
  - 🚧 **Barrier**: Construction or road work.
  - 💧 **Drop**: Water-logging or flooding.
- **Clustering**: When zoomed out, multiple events group into circles with a number. Tap or zoom in to expand them.

## 2. Planning a Route
- **Long Press**: Long-press any destination on the map to calculate a route from your current location.
- **Auto-Risk**: The system will automatically calculate the risk level for the generated path.

## 3. Understanding the Risk Card
When a route is selected, a card appears with:
- **Color Coding**: 
  - 🟢 **Green**: Low Risk (Safe passage).
  - 🟠 **Orange**: Medium Risk (Proceed with caution).
  - 🔴 **Red**: High Risk (Consider an alternative route).
- **Statistics**: Shows total distance (km) and estimated duration (min).
- **Progress Bar**: Represents the relative intensity of disruptions along that specific path.

## 4. Connectivity Badge
The top badge shows if you are synced with the backend:
- **Backend Connected**: Live data is being received.
- **Sync Error**: The app is displaying cached data. Check your internet connection.
