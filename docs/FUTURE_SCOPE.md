# Future Scope

UDIE is designed to scale beyond a simple navigation aid into a comprehensive **Urban Intelligence Platform**.

## Technological Horizons
- **Edge Computing**: Moving the risk heuristic to the mobile device for ultra-low latency updates.
- **AR Navigation**: Projecting disruption markers onto a 3D augmented reality view for pedestrians.
- **V2X Integration**: Communicating directly with smart city infrastructure to update risk levels in milliseconds.

## Data Expansion
- **Civic Sensors**: Integrating with IoT water-level sensors to provide real-time flood intelligence.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the intensity of social media reports to dynamically adjust event `confidence` scores.

## Ecosystem Impact
- **Logistics Integration**: Helping delivery fleets avoid high-risk zones to reduce insurance premiums and vehicle downtime.
- **Public Safety**: Providing a dashboard for city officials to visualize infrastructure hotspots.
